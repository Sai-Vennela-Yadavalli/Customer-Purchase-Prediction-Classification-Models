# 🧠 Customer Purchase Prediction – Classification Models

This project focuses on building and comparing three classification algorithms to predict customer purchase behaviour. The models were evaluated using standard metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

---

## 📂 Algorithms Implemented

1. **🌳 Decision Tree Classifier**
2. **🌲 Random Forest Classifier**
3. **📈 Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Each model is implemented using a Jupyter notebook and evaluated on classification performance for two target classes: **Purchased** and **Not Purchased**.

---

## 📝 Evaluation Metrics Used

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Macro Average
- Weighted Average

📄 For detailed Q&A and metric explanations, refer to the uploaded **Documentation.pdf**.
